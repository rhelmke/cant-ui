# cant-ui

***Disclaimer: This is academic code that has been written in a timespan of roughly 2 weeks for my Bachelor's thesis. I am neither a frontend developer nor have I ever worked with ReactJS before. It's ugly, insecure and shitty. Yet, it did the job back in the days. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK (or maybe you are willing to create a proper frontend?:-)***

This is [cant](https://github.com/rhelmke/cant)'s webinterface outsourced into a standalone
repository.
Unless you are a developer that wants to contribute to this project, you shouldn't need to clone
this repository, as cant will autofetch and -build this webinterface.

## Get and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rhelmke/cant-ui.git
yarn install
yarn build
```

## Dependencies

* ReactJS
* Node
* npm
